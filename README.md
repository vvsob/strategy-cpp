# Strategy (cpp)

This repository contains the source code for a C++ library `strategy-cpp`, intended for writing checker and generator programs to be used for the testing system I wrote in 2023, see https://github.com/vvsob/novocode

The library's philosophy is different from the popular `testlib`, see tests for code examples.
